A repository of files used to design and document the creation of a Virtual Pipe Organ.

The project is built around the <a href="https://github.com/GrandOrgue/grandorgue">Grand Orgue</a> project.

* The console is built out of 2 x M-audio Keystation 61es MIDI keyboards
* The pistons are made from black thumbtacks, wired up to a <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html">Teensy 4.1</a> microcontroller.
* The stop jambs are 4 Android tablets, running StreamDeck with a <a href="https://trevligaspel.se/streamdeck/midi/index.php">MIDI plugin</a>:
  * 2 x Asus ZenPad 10 (Z300M) 16GB 10" tablets (Swell and Great & Pedal)
  * 2 x Asus Zenpad 8 (Z380M) 16GB 8" tablets (Couplers and Choir)
* The pedalboard is a full 30-note concave radiating standards-compliant pedalboard, which has been MIDI-fied by me using another Teensy 4.1 with reed switches providing the inputs. The magnets to actuate the reed switches are mounted on screws under the end of each pedal, meaning the pedalboard is 'all inclusive' (i.e. there's no separate back plate which contains the reed switches).
* The VPO used is 'St Matthew, Cheltenham' fom <a href="https://barrittaudio.co.uk/products/st-matthew-cheltenham-sample-set">Barritt Audio</a>. 
  * NB - This is a Hauptwerk organ, but there's a GrandOrgue ODF available courtesy of 'ahall41' on <a href="https://mps-orgelseite.de/home/filebase/index.php?file/214-go-odf-for-father-willis-organ-st-matthew-cheltenham/#versions">MPS Orgel Seite</a>.
  * I've used the 1.4 release, but have <a href="./Custom ODFs/Cheltenham full.1.4.organ">extended</a> the keyboard compass from 57 to 61 notes.

It's a work in progress, and things will likely change as the project develops over time.  For instance I'd love to add a 3<sup>rd</sup> manual to the console.
