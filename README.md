A repository of files used to design and document the creation of a Virtual Pipe Organ.

The project is built around the <a href="https://github.com/GrandOrgue/grandorgue">Grand Orgue</a> project.

* The console is built out of 2 x M-audio Keystation 61es MIDI keyboards
* The pistons are made from black thumbtacks, wired up to a <a href="https://thepihut.com/products/teensy-4-1?variant=32076872679486&currency=GBP&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=bing&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&msclkid=fd9d24b8d2011e2f6002421657289d38&utm_term=4585375811816273">Teensy 4.1</a> microcontroller.
* The stop jambs are 4 Android tablets, running StreamDeck with a <a href="https://trevligaspel.se/streamdeck/midi/index.php">MIDI plugin</a>:
  * 2 x Asus ZenPad 10 (Z300M) 16GB 10" tablets (Swell and Great & Pedal)
  * 2 x Asus Zenpad 8 (Z380M) 16GB 8" tablets (Couplers and Choir)
* The pedalboard is a full 30-note concave radiating standards-compliant pedalboard, which will be MIDI-fied by me using another Teensy 4.1 with reed switches providing the inputs.

It's a work in progress, and things will likely change as the project develops over time.  For instance, once the current configuration is up and running, I'd love to add a 3<sup>rd</sup> manual to the console.
