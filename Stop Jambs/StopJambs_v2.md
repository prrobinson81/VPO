A new project has been undertaken to replace the current tablets used as stop jambs, with physical controls.

The tablets were running the app version of Elgato StreamDeck, and as such required a steady Wi-Fi connection to the host laptop in order to work.  However it turned out the Wi-Fi just wasnâ€™t stable enough on these (rather old) models, and so they would randomly drop connections, reset, or otherwise just lose sync with the GrandOrgue VPO, making it impossible to know what stops were pulled.

The new project replaces these 4 tablets, with 2 custom-made jambs.

Each jamb consists of:
* Protoboard (90mm x 150mm) x 4
* Momentary switches (5mm) x 30
* Diodes x 30
* Adafruit NeoPixel 5mm Diffused Though-Hole LEDs x 30
